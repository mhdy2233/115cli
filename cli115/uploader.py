        """Upload a local file or directory to the remote filesystem.

        If ``local_path`` is a directory, the directory tree is uploaded
        recursively into ``remote_path``. If ``local_path`` is a file and
        ``remote_path`` points to an existing remote directory, the local
        filename is appended to the destination path. Uses ``client.file.upload``
        and ``client.file.create_directory`` under the hood.

        When uploading a directory, ``include`` and ``exclude`` glob patterns
        control which files are transferred.  Patterns follow the gitignore /
        VS Code glob syntax — for example ``"**/*.log"`` excludes all log files
        and ``"temp/**"`` excludes the ``temp/`` subtree.  See
        https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/glob-patterns for the full
        syntax reference.  Patterns are matched against paths relative to the
        root of the uploaded directory (using ``/`` separators).

        Args:
            local_path: Path to the local file or directory.
            remote_path: Destination path on the remote.
            instant_only: If set to a byte threshold (e.g. ``100 * 1024 * 1024``
                for 100 MB), files at or above that size will be forced to use
                instant upload only.  Values below
                :data:`~cli115.client.base.MIN_INSTANT_UPLOAD_SIZE` (2 MB) are
                ignored.  Raises
                :class:`~cli115.exceptions.InstantUploadNotAvailableError` when
                instant upload is unavailable for a qualifying file.
            part_size: Part size in bytes for multipart uploads. Defaults to
                the uploader's ``part_size`` or 16 MB.
            max_workers: Number of concurrent file uploads when uploading a
                directory. Defaults to the uploader's ``max_workers`` (1).
            include: Glob patterns for files to include.  Only files matching at
                least one pattern are uploaded.  ``None`` means include all files.
            exclude: Glob patterns for files to exclude.  Files matching any
                pattern are skipped.  ``None`` means exclude nothing.

        Returns:
            The created or existing remote directory entry when uploading a directory, or the
            result returned by ``client.file.upload`` when uploading a file. `None`
            is returned when ``dry_run`` is ``True``.

        Raises:
            FileExistsError: If attempting to upload a directory to a remote file path.
            FileNotFoundError: If the target remote directory does not exist.
