An unofficial CLI tool and *Python* library for [115.com](https://115.com) cloud storage. It provides a command-line interface for common file operations and a higher-level *Python* API client that can be used as a library in your own code.

Read [disclaimer](#disclaimer) carefully before using this tool.

## Installation

```bash
pip install 115cli
```

## Usage

### CLI

After [authenticating](#authentication) with `115cli login`, you can use the `115cli` command to interact with your 115 cloud storage. Here are some examples of available commands:

```bash
# Authenticate with cookies
115cli login cookie "UID=xxx; CID=xxx; SEID=xxx; KID=xxx"

# Account info
115cli account

# List files
115cli ls /
115cli ls /path/to/dir -l
115cli ls --id 1234567
# Sort by creation time, newest first
115cli ls -l --sort created --desc

# File operations
115cli mkdir /new-folder
115cli cp /src/file.txt /dst/
115cli mv /old/path /new/path
115cli rename /old/path/file.txt new-file.txt
115cli rm /path/to/file
115cli rm -r /path/to/dir
115cli find /search/path keyword

# File info and download
115cli stat /path/to/file
115cli id 1234567
115cli url /path/to/file
115cli url --format aria2c /path/to/file

# Download a file to local disk
115cli fetch /path/to/file.mp4
115cli fetch /path/to/file.mp4 -o /local/save/path.mp4
115cli fetch --id 1234567 -o /local/save/path.mp4
# Download a folder recursively, with integrity check
115cli fetch /path/to/dir/ -o /local/save/dir/ --check-integrity
# Download with include/exclude patterns
115cli fetch /path/to/dir/ -o /local/save/dir/ --include "**/*.mkv" --include "**/*.mp4" --exclude "secret/*"

# Upload (support instant upload)
115cli upload /local/file.txt /remote/dir/file.txt
# Upload with instant upload only
115cli upload --instant-only /local/file.txt /remote/dir/file.txt
# Upload a folder
115cli upload /local/folder/ /remote/dir/
# Upload with include/exclude patterns
115cli upload /local/folder/ /remote/dir/ --include "**/*.mkv" --include "**/*.mp4" --exclude "secret/*"
# Upload multiple files concurrently with custom part size
115cli upload /local/folder/ /remote/dir/ -j 4 --part-size 32M

# Cloud download (offline download)
115cli download quota
115cli download list
115cli download list --filter completed
115cli download add "https://example.com/file.mp4"
115cli download delete <info_hash>
115cli download status <info_hash>
115cli download retry <info_hash>
115cli download clear --filter failed

# File share
115cli share info https://115.com/s/1234567 -p 6666
115cli share list https://115.com/s/1234567?password=6666
115cli share list https://115.com/s/1234567?password=6666 /dir/
115cli share stat https://115.com/s/1234567?password=6666 /path/to/file.txt
115cli share save https://115.com/s/1234567?password=6666 --dest /my/dir/
115cli share save https://115.com/s/1234567?password=6666 /path/in/share/ --dest /my/dir/ --include *.mp4 --include *.mkv --exclude *.txt

# Export directory tree
115cli export /path/to/dir -o ./tree.txt
115cli export --id 1234567 -o ./tree.txt

# Stream a video file
115cli stream /path/to/video.mp4
# Transcode a video file to make it available for streaming
115cli transcode /path/to/video.mp4
```

> **Note:** Creating cloud download tasks may trigger a captcha challenge. This is currently not supported by the client.

#### Authentication

115cli currently only supports cookie-based authentication. Obtain your cookies from the browser after logging into [115.com](https://115.com). You need the `UID`, `CID`, `SEID`, and `KID` cookie values.

```bash
115cli login cookie "UID=xxx; CID=xxx; SEID=xxx; KID=xxx"
```

### Python API

The package also exposes a higher-level Python API client that you can use in your own projects:

```python
from cli115.auth import CookieAuth
from cli115.client import create_client

auth = CookieAuth(
    uid="xxx",
    cid="xxx",
    seid="xxx",
    kid="xxx"
)
client = create_client(auth)

# List directory
entries = client.file.list("/")
for entry in entries:
    print(entry.name, entry.id)

# Get file info
info = client.file.stat("/path/to/file.txt")
print(info.name, info.size, info.sha1)

# Download info
dl = client.file.url("/path/to/file.txt")
print(dl.url)

# Fetch a remote file as a lazy file-like object
with client.file.open("/path/to/file.txt") as rf:
    data = rf.read(1024)   # only downloads the first 1024 bytes

# Upload
result = client.file.upload("/remote/dir/", "/local/file.txt")

# Cloud download
client.download.add_url("https://example.com/file.mp4")
tasks = client.download.list()
```

> This project is in an early stage of development, it may subject to breaking changes in the future.

## Future Plans

The project aims to cover the core features of 115 cloud storage. Planned additions include:

- **QRCode login** - Implementing QR code-based authentication for easier login without needing to manually extract cookies.

## Credits
Some non-web API implementations are learned from [**p115client**](https://github.com/ChenyangGao/p115client), which provides some non-web API implementations. Include but not limited to:
  * ECDH-AES encryption/decryption for file content and metadata.
  * Instant upload support by calculating file hashes and interacting with the corresponding APIs.
  * Multipart upload support for large files.

## Disclaimer

This is an **unofficial** client for *115.com* and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with *115.com* or its parent company in any way.

Use at your own risk. The authors are not responsible for any account suspension, data loss, or other consequences arising from the use of this software. The API may change at any time without notice, which could break this tool.

You may encounter *Aliyun WAF* blocks when using the library, the mechanism and consequences are currently unknown. It may relate to the frequency of API calls. After being blocked, you may need to wait for a while before retrying, the official web interface may also be affected during the block period.
